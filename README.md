# Portfolio Selection Problem

"Portfolio optimization problems involve selection of different assets to invest in order to maximize the overall return and minimize the overall risk simultaneously. The complexity of the optimal asset allocation problem increases with an increase in the number of assets available to select from for investing."

In this small project we are going to solve portfolio selection problem using parametric simplex method.
